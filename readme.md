# Advent of Code 2020
Woo it's fun! I'm using [lua](https://lua.org/), and programming using a nice little cli editor called JOE, or [Joe's Own Editor](https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/).
I know all the code is terrible, but that's kind of the point! Well, for me at least my goal isn't to make good code, but just fast code (fast to write, that is).
